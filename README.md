# Server Performance Stats

## Overview

Server Performance Stats is a project inspired by DevOps [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats) project. In this project we will analyze a server performance with a **bash script**, specifically for following components; **cpu**, **memory**, and **disk usage**.

## Goal
Analyze node/server performance for following components ⤵️

1. Total CPU usage.
2. Total memory usage; free, used, and the percentage of each.
3. Total disk usage; free, used, and the percentage of each.
4. Top 5 process by CPU usage.
5. Top 5 process by memory usage.

## Improvement
As improvement, analyze all the main components goal in real time. Used monitoring tools such as prometheus or Netdata.

The idea is get the components information periodically, publish it as telemetry data (metrics/logs) to monitoring tools, and visualize it as diagram/chart to analyze the data in real-time.
